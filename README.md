System of linear equations generator
===========

This project generates arbitrary-sized matrices for testing solutions for system of linear equations.

In order to avoid inconsistent systems, it checks for independence of equations and the overall consistency.

Example of usage:

    Sole s = Sole.generate(10);
    
Where `10` is the number of variable, os size.
